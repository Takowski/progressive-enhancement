<h2>The story</h2>

<p class="bold">Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.
    They said,<q class="villager">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q> The farmer said,
     <strong><q class="farmer">Maybe.</q></strong> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,
     <q class="villager">“Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”</q> The farmer again said, <strong><q class="farmer">Maybe.</q></strong></p> 

<p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.
    The neighbors then said,<q class="villager">Oh dear, that’s too <label class="bad">bad</label>,</q>  and the farmer responded,
     <strong><q class="farmer">Maybe.</q></strong> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army,
      and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said,
      <q class="villager">Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, <strong><q class="farmer">Maybe.</q></strong></p>

       <blockquote>
        <q class="quote">The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity,
            and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is
             <label class="good">good</label> or <label class="bad">bad</label> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune;
              or, you never know what will be the consequences of <label class="good">good</label> fortune</q>
